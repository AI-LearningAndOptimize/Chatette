[]                  word group
~[]                 alias
%[]                 intent (generate them all)
%[](2)              intent (with number of generations asked)
@[]                 slot

[name#precision]    identifier of the word group is `name` but gives a `precision`
                    for a word group: ignore `precision`
                    for an alias: consider that the identifier is `name` => ~[name] identifies every ~[name#anything]
                    for an intent: ignore `precision`
                    for a slot: `name` is the slot identifier but `precision` maps to different values (same as alias)
[any?]              word group `any` has 50% chance of being generated
[any?id]            generation of `any` is identified as `id` and any word group with generation identified the same will be generated iff `any` was generated
[any?/60]           word group `any` has 60% chance of being generated
[any?id/70]         id.
[any#precision?id/20]
[&name]             `name` will be generated starting with a lowercase or uppercase letter (50% chance) /!\ not usable in a top declaration
